- **capture.rs** now acts as a pure screenshot service. `capture_screenshot()` captures the full primary monitor, saves it as `screenshots/current_board.png` (creates dir if needed), and returns `()` on success. Dropped all cropping/bounds logic (moved responsibility to OCR), updated docs/tests/comments, and kept `DEBUG_CAPTURE=1` for an extra full-screen debug save. Latency reporting adjusted to "full screenshot capture."
- **ocr.rs** updated to `board_to_fen(path: &str) -> Result<String>`, which loads the PNG via `image::open()`, binds the full `DynamicImage` (prefixed `_` to avoid unused var warning), and the todo!() now emphasizes board detection/cropping as the first step (e.g., contours for grid finding). Docs/tests adjusted accordingly—test now uses a dummy path expecting io::Error (passes without panic).
- **main.rs** pipeline tweaked: calls `capture_screenshot()` first (saves PNG), then passes the fixed path to `ocr::board_to_fen()`. Removed the intermediate `board_img` var. Comments updated for clarity.

This compiles cleanly (`cargo check` passes, no errors/warnings after fixes), and the code is runnable immediately (up to the todo!() panics in OCR/engine). To test the capture/save flow:
- Ensure macOS permissions: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen & System Audio Recording > enable Terminal.
- Run `cargo run` (or `DEBUG_CAPTURE=1 cargo run` for extra debug PNG). It should print startup msg, capture/save PNG every 500ms, then panic at OCR todo (expected). Check `screenshots/current_board.png`—it'll be your full screen; OCR will "pick it up" next when implemented.
- For capture test: `cargo test capture -- --ignored` (requires display/permissions; verifies saved image dims >0 and reasonable size).

This setup gives the flexibility you want—no hardcoded bounds, works for any app/window position (including macOS Chess.app—just open it on primary display), and OCR can start naive (e.g., assume board is central/large region) before adding smart detection. Perf impact is there (full image load/process), but measurable—add timing in OCR to profile. If it feels slow later, we can reintroduce optional cropping in capture (e.g., via config bounds) without much rework.
